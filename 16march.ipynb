    "Q1: Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how can they be mitigated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting: Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise or random fluctuations in the data as if they were meaningful patterns. The consequences include poor generalization to unseen data, leading to high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the test set. Overfitting can be mitigated by using techniques such as regularization, cross-validation, and collecting more data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting: Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data. The consequences include high bias and low accuracy on both the training and test sets. Underfitting can be mitigated by using more complex models, adding more features, or reducing regularization.\n",
